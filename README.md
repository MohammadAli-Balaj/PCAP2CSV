PCAP2CSV Pipeline

The PCAP2CSV Pipeline efficiently converts PCAP (Packet Capture) files into structured CSV format with labeled data. This pipeline extracts detailed packet-level information from network captures, labels the packets based on predefined criteria, transforms the data into a tabular format, and saves it as a CSV file. The labeled CSV output is ideal for network traffic analysis, data preprocessing, and integration with other analytics tools, facilitating enhanced data insights and easier processing.
