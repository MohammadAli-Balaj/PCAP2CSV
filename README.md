The PCAP2CSV Pipeline efficiently converts PCAP (Packet Capture) files into a structured CSV format, tailored for label-based analysis. This pipeline extracts detailed packet-level information from network captures, organizes it into a tabular format, and saves it as a CSV file. It is specifically designed to facilitate the labeling of network traffic for tasks such as data annotation, machine learning model training, and advanced network analysis. Ideal for preparing labeled datasets for predictive modeling and integrating network data with analytics tools.
